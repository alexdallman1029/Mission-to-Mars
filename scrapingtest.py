# We're using an f-string for this print statement because it's a cleaner way to create print statements; 
# they're also evaluated at run-time. This means that it, and the variable it holds, doesn't exist until 
# the code is executed and the values are not constant. 
# This works well for our scraping app because the data we're scraping is live and will be updated frequently.

# Now we're going to scrape a table of facts from a different website
# Tables in HTML are basically made up of many smaller containers. 
# The main container is the <table /> tag. 
# Inside the table is <tbody />, which is the body of the tableâ€”the headers, columns, and rows.
# <tr /> is the tag for each table row. Within that tag, the table data is stored in <td /> tags. 
# This is where the columns are established.

# Instead of scraping each row, or the data in each <td />, 
# we're going to scrape the entire table with Pandas' .read_html() function.

# The Pandas function read_html() specifically searches for and returns a list of tables found in the HTML. 
# By specifying an index of 0, we're telling Pandas to pull only the first table it encounters, 
# or the first item in the list. Then, it turns the table into a DataFrame.

# End the automated browsing session. This is an important to add to our web app also. 
# Without it, the automated browser won't know to shut down
# It will continue to listen for instructions and use the computer's resources 
# (it may put a strain on memory or a laptop's battery if left on). 

# We can't automate the scraping using the Jupyter Notebook. 
# To fully automate it, it will need to be converted into a .py file.
# After downloading as .py, we will need to clean up the code in a text editor. 

# Info on noSQL databases, MongoDB
# JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, is a method that sorts and presents data in the form of key:value pairs. 
# It looks much like a Python dictionary and can be traversed through using list notation.
# A Mongo database contains collections. These collections contain documents, and each document contains fields, 
# and fields are where the data is stored.

# Before the code is ready for deployment, we need to integrate scraping code in a way that Flask can handle. 
# That means updating it to include functions and even some error handling. 
# This will help with our app's performance and add a level of professionalism to the end product.
