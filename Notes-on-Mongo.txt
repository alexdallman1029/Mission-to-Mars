#Using mongo and mongo db
#Make sure you are in conda environment (in this case, PythonData)
#1. Run mongod in git bash (must have this running in the backgroud)
#2. Run new git bash and run mongo

#use creates new db named "practice db" 
use practice db 

#show all dbs
show dbs

#show collections
show collections

#"Hey, Mongo, use the database we've already specified, and insert a document into this collection. 
# If there's not a collection named that, then create one."
db.collectionName.insertOne({key:value})

# delete collections
db.collectionName.deleteOne({key:value})

# remove whole db
db.collectionName.remove({})

# drop method
db.collectionName.drop()

# drop db
db.dropDatabase()

# One really great part about how we interact with Mongo through the terminal is that it works really well with Python script and Flask.
# Flask is a web microframework that helps developers build a web application. 
# The Pythonic tools and libraries it comes with provide the means to create anything 
# from a small webpage or blog or something large enough for commercial use.

#See app.py for next steps.
